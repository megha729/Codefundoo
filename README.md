We can detect the agricultural drought of a region by calculating the correlation between NDVI and LST.
The Combination of (NDVI) normalized difference vegetation index and LST, provides very useful information for agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system for the farmers. By calculating the correlation between LST and NDVI, it can be clearly noticed that they show a high negative correlation.
We can use geospatial techniques like remote sensing for monitoring of droughts.
