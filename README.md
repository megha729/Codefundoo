Early Warning System for Drought Assessment:



Droughts strike our country from time to time and destroy many crops as well as the livelihood of many farmers,  putting the country in peril.Agriculture in India is highly dependent on monsoon which is highly unpredictable. Therefore, it is necassary to have alternate measures.
According to SMI(Soil Moisture Index) data, the drought distribution is classified into four major groups. SMI values > 0.3 are considered not to be drought and SMI values < 0.3 are classified as slight, moderate, and severe drought.
Studies have shown that lower SMI values and greater rainfall departure or negative anomaly leads to the decline in the production or agriculture productivity.
We can detect the agricultural drought of a region by calculating the correlation between NDVI and LST.
The Combination of (NDVI) normalized difference vegetation index and LST, provides very useful information for agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system for the farmers. By calculating the correlation between LST and NDVI, it can be clearly noticed that they show a high negative correlation.
We can use geospatial techniques like remote sensing and GIS for monitoring of droughts.
The different varying parameters such as increasing temperature and changing weather greatly alters the soil properties and hence result in decrease of crop production.
We can calculate soil moisture index which represents soil moisture content.
We shall be using sensors and technologies currently available like GIS to detect the present soil quality and pre-analyse the drought vulnerability in that area.
