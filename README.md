Droughts strike our country from time to time and destroy many crops as well as the livelihood of many farmers,  putting the country in peril.
We can detect the agricultural drought of a region by calculating the correlation between NDVI and LST.
The Combination of (NDVI) normalized difference vegetation index and LST, provides very useful information for agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system for the farmers. By calculating the correlation between LST and NDVI, it can be clearly noticed that they show a high negative correlation.
We can use geospatial techniques like remote sensing and GIS for monitoring of droughts.
The different varying parameters such as increasing temperature and changing weather greatly alters the soil properties and hencce result in decrease of crop production.
Agriculture in India is highly dependent on monsoon which is highly unpredictable. Therefore, it is necassary to have alternate measures.
